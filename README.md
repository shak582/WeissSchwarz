============

Lets do this guys, this game will be written with C++ and depending on our needs we might implement some lua scripts for certain nececities. We currently have a server in digital ocean that can provide enough needs to beta test the game, and we have a temporal domain http://www.shak582.com (it's the only domain I had currently has nothing). I am thinking the server should be written in python to save us some effort. Oh and it is a Ubuntu server.

our irc is #weissschwarzprog in freenode so we can discus anything partaining to the project. 

This is something I am willing to spend plenty of time working on this but of course I need some support. Either way this will be finished. The first thing to decide is wether we use directX or openGL and of course this can be a decision that can affect portability so I don't want to just decide without having a second opinion. Now the way we are going to build this is that we have a database that holds information about all cards, and obviously we build the engine in a way that we can use this information to play the game. I currently have a MySQL database that has certain things like ID, name, card type, level, cost, counter, trigger, power, and soul points. Now for the engine itself I still haven't thought of how we would implement it completely but i've got some ideas.

Well this is a work on progress but progress will be done and hopefully this will be finished soon. Any help of course will be greatly appreciated.
